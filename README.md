# Determining-The-Vigilance-of-Road-Accident-Hotspots-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques
Traffic accidents are among the most critical issues facing the world as they cause 
many deaths, injuries, and fatalities as well as economic losses every year. Accurate 
models to predict the traffic accident severity is a critical task for transportation 
systems. This investigation effort establishes models to select a set of influential 
factors and to build up a model for classifying the severity of injuries. These models 
are formulated by various machine learning techniques. Supervised machine learning 
algorithms, such as Decision Tree (DT), Logistic Regression (LR) and Random 
Forests (RF), K-Nearest Neighborâ€™s (KNN) are implemented on traffic accident data. 
SMOTE algorithm is used to handle data imbalance. An RF model can provide 
insights into the severity of traffic injuries, according to the result of this study. RF 
algorithm has shown better performance with 72% accuracy than LR with 67.5%, DT
with 63.6% accuracy and KNN with 62.3%
